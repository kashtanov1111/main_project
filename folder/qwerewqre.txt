 In a high power distance culture, a person’s social status must be clear 
so that others can accord them with appropriate respect; hence global 
brands serve that purpose. In cultures 
with a large power distance, each person has their rightful place in 
a social hierarchy. A society with a high power distance has 
a hierarchical order with vertically stratified power positions existing 
to create lots of power status. Consumers of large power distance are likely to select domestic products rather than imports because they feel obliged to obey and serve
their home country. They are expected to show more patriotic buying behavior for the home
country.

Low individualism societies show tight integration. In collectivistic cultures, 
people are “we”-conscious. In such cultures a person’s identity is based 
on the social system of which they are members. The influence by others plays an important role in the decision 
making processes of consumers. Collectivistic consumers are ethnocentric and feel obliged to buy domestic products.
Because they love and are loyal
to domestic products, patriotic consumers show high intentions of buying
domestic products and low intentions of buying foreign products


Short-term orientation includes personal steadiness and stability and respect for tradition. Here, focus is put on the pursuit of happiness rather than on 
pursuance of peace of mind.
